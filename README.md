Repository created for a basic suspension system model for a single wheel

Repository contains: simulink model, startup code in matlab, gitattributes file, Image of the derivation,

download the repo and run the model to obtain the result.

----------------------- Assumptions made -----------------------------------------

FOR ROAD PROFILE:

MIT open courseware document is attached in the project. 

The document is about forces exerted on the tires because of speed bumps. Figure 8-12 gives a brief approx for the same. 
Since we are considering the forces for regular driving, the accleration values have been assumed to be around 25% of the values given in the table. 
Since these are acceleration values, mass of the vehicle body and wheel have been multipled to these values and then given to the model.

FOR SPRING CONSTANT and DAMPING COEFFICIENTS VALUES:

Suspension_values document has a few values given for the constants. Mass of the car is assumed to be 2000 kg Mass of the tire has been assumed to be kg spring constant of suspension: 16000 N/m spring constant of suspension: 60000 N/m Damping coefficient of damper: 2000 N/m/s
